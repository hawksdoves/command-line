Create a directory that you want to become a git repository:
mkdir gitDir
cd gitDir
git init

On github, create a repository called say gitDir
git remote add origin git@github.com:hawksdoves/getDir.git    connects the 2 repositories; 1 local, 1 on github
git push -u origin master  push these changes to github

touch file                          create new file
git add file                        it is now stage and ready to be commit
git commit -m "first commit"        commit to changes and comment (-m)
git push origin master              push these changes to github


If you accidentally initialise a git repo in a folder that shouldn't be under version control, 
e.g. by running git init in ~/Desktop, you can revert the change by removing the hidden .git folder:
            rm -rf .git

git remote -v       lists if there are any remotes set up in the given directory i.e. does it exist and it is pointing in the right direction

git checkout hash   takes you back to that particular hash, "travel back in time!"

git status          shows what hasn't been tracked
